/**
 * The 14-day path: all 40 letters, three a day, easy shapes first.
 *
 * Two constraints shape the order, and they pull against each other:
 *
 *   - A day must be *readable*. Every day from the first carries at least one
 *     vowel or one consonant that pairs with what came before, so the student
 *     can build a real syllable the same evening rather than collecting
 *     letters for a week.
 *   - Letters that look or sound alike must not arrive together. Meeting ㅏ and
 *     ㅑ for the first time on the same day is how they end up permanently
 *     swapped. Instead the second one lands a day or more later and is
 *     *deliberately* contrasted with the first, which by then is established.
 *
 * Hence `contrast`: the pair that day drills head to head, always an older
 * letter against the new one that threatens it. Day 1 has none — nothing is
 * established yet.
 *
 * The derivation groups (add a stroke = add a puff of air; double a letter =
 * tense it) are kept intact and simply arrive late: ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅊ in days 8–10,
 * the five doubles in days 10–12, the compound vowels last.
